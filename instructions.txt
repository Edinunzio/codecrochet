Round One:
Chain 3.
Dc into first chain.
Dc again into first chain. You now have a cluster of three dc because the first chain three counts as the first dc.

Chain 2; this create the space that will become your first corner.
3 dc into the same chain spot. Ch 2 to make your next corner. Repeat that previous step twice more.
Slip stitch into the top chain of the first “chain three” to close the round. Your smallest center square is now complete.

Round Two:
To begin the next round, you will chain three. This counts as the first dc of the round.

Make 2 dc into the same corner as the ch 3.

In the following corner:
3 dc, 2 ch, 3 dc. This makes the new corner.

Repeat this in the next corner.

In the final corner, you will make 3 dc, chain two and then slip stitch to the top of the first chain in the first “chain three” to close the round.

Round Three:
Your next round begins in the same manner as round two. Chain three and then 2 dc into the same corner. 

You will see that the next space is not a corner but just a space. Make 3 dc in this space.

Your next space is the corner, so you will make 3 dc, 2 ch, 3 dc into the corner. Repeat the previous two steps around the square. When you get to the final space, make 3 dc, ch 2 and sl st to the top of the first chain three to close the round.


Round Four:
Round four is similar to round three except that you are now working with a larger square so there will be two chain spaces in each row between each corner. 

You can continue increasing the size of your granny square to make it as large as you would like. Simply work 3 dc, 2ch, 3dc in each corner and 3 dc in each space, joining at the end of each row and beginning the new round with a ch 3 for the first dc stitch. The classic crochet granny square is generally considered to be a five round granny square.
